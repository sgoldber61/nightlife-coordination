This is a nightlife coordination app written with Full-Stack JavaScript. Users can search for bars/nightlife (using Yelp's [API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yelp-fusion)) and see how many others are going. Authenticated users can indicate that they are going.

This project was made with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB with Passport authentication on the back end. The front end is written in React with Redux and is based off of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The app can be found on Heroku [here](https://github.com/sgoldber61/nightlife-coordination.git).
